# 接口

The best approach is to write the `specification` early and revise it as we learn from the ongoing implementation.

先写出规范（API），再结合实现不断完善

## Interface Principles

* `Hide` implementation details.
  * information hiding, encapsulation, abstraction, modularization…
  * We strongly recommend **against** `publicly visible data` in all forms; it is too hard to maintain consistency of values if users can change variables at will.
  * Avoid `global variables`; wherever possible it is better to pass references to all data through function arguments.（这个有讨论的）
* Choose a small orthogonal set of primitives. 
  * （这里的意思是，选取的 primitives 之间功能不要重复）
  * An interface should provide as much functionality as necessary but no more, and the functions should not overlap excessively in their capabilities.
  * API 提供的，应该是不多也不少的函数
* 一致性和规范性
