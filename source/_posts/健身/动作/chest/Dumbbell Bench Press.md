### 入门指导

1. Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.

   坐在长凳上，握好哑铃，将哑铃放在大腿上，手掌相对。

2. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.

   然后，利用大腿来顶起哑铃，一次顶一个。哑铃的宽度为肩宽

3. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.

   调整到肩宽后，旋转手腕，调整到手掌朝向外面。哑铃位置应该在胸部旁边，上臂和前臂呈 90°。注意任何时候都要完全控制住哑铃。这就是起始的姿势

4. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.

   然后，伴随着呼气，使用胸部力量将哑铃推上去。在最高处时，锁住手臂，挤压胸部，保持一秒后缓慢降下。提示：下降的时间大约是上升时的两倍长

5. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

## 注意

**Caution:** When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

当做完练习后，不要直接丢掉哑铃。这会伤害你的肩膀，也可能伤害到旁边的人

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.

## tips

1. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself.

2. Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to arch excessively.

3. Keep your feet flat on the floor and don’t allow the lower body to move during the set.

4. **Don’t:** Clang the dumbbells together at the top.

   不要让哑铃在空中撞击

5. Breathe in on the descent and breathe out forcefully on the ascent of each repetition.

6. ​
