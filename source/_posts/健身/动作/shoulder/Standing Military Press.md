### 姿势入门指导

1. Start by placing a barbell that is about chest high on a squat rack. Once you have selected the weights, grab the barbell using a pronated (palms facing forward) grip. Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder width apart from each other.

   手握姿势：手掌朝前。握距比肩宽大

2. Slightly bend the knees and place the barbell on your collar bone. Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest. Take a step back and position your feet shoulder width apart from each other.

   略微弯曲膝盖，将杠铃放到锁骨高度。举起杠铃，让重量落在胸上。

3. Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.

   锁定上臂，将杠铃举过头顶。

4. Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.

5. Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.

6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
