### 姿势入门

1. Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.

   在 pull-down 机旁坐下。检查机器上的膝盖垫子的高度是否适合自己。这些垫子的作用是防止你被杆的反向力“翘起”

2. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.

   手掌朝前，抓牢杠。因为是宽距握法，所以手伸开的距离要比肩宽大（中距握法则等于肩宽，窄距握法则小于肩宽）

3. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.

   手臂向前握住杠后（按照对应宽度），躯干向后大约30°，挺胸，后背下部弯曲

4. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. **Tip:**Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.

   随着体内气体呼出（这会增强核心肌肉），使用肩部力量拉下杠铃，直到它到达上胸处

   tips:  一旦达到 the full contracted position，集中精力挤压后背的肌肉。上半身应该保持固定，只有手臂才应该移动。前臂只是用来 holding 铁杠，不要借助前臂的力量去拉下铁杆

5. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.

   挤压维持一秒后，缓慢上升，直到手臂完全伸展，背阔肌也完全“铺开”。在这个过程中的某个部分进行吸气

6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
