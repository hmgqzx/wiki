### 姿势入门

1. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip.

   走近杠铃，让杠铃的投影处于脚的中间。脚的站距应该和髋宽差不多。髋部弯曲，抓杠铃，手的距离为肩宽

2. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.

   脚站稳，手抓牢后，深吸一大口气，继续下降髋部、屈膝，直到小腿碰到杠铃。正视前方（？）

3. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.

   当杠铃经过膝盖后，竭力地向后拉起杠铃（肩胛骨收缩，髋部向前[但不要过度，恢复到正常位置即可]）

4. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
